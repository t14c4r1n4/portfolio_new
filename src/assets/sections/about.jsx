          <p>
            In 2022, after another <span className="keywords">temporary job</span>, I decided that it was time for a <span className="keywords">change</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While traveling, I met a girl who worked as an <span className="keywords">online marketing manager</span>, and it piqued my interest. I began a <span className="keywords">correspondence course</span> to become a certified online marketing manager, which also included some <span className="keywords">HTML5 and CSS3 modules</span>. I found myself fascinated by what I could create with these languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I received an offer for a course as an <span className="keywords">Online Shop Developer</span> with <span className="keywords">Python</span> Basics. This marked my introduction to programming, and I discovered a <span className="keywords">passion for web development</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I delved into <span className="keywords">Django</span>, and later, <span className="keywords">JavaScript</span>, <span className="keywords">React</span>, and <span className="keywords">Vue</span>. Currently, I favor React for its simple syntax and vibrant community.
          </p>
        </div>
      )}
      <div className="p-2">
        <p>Today, I proudly present my <span className="keywords">first completed project in React</span>: <br />My Portfolio Website.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
